About the Java and python retake task
For the second part of your assignment you will take on a project in either java or python. If you plan to take programming II next year then you should do java, otherwise you have a free choice. Otherwise the time task is the same- in both languages the project will involve writing OO classes to represent standard pack of playing cards suitable for casino-type games like poker, Blackjack etc. you will need to build an Object-oriented model of this deck of cards then use this as the basis for your game.
Ultimately, the project is to implement the card game, Higher or Lower (aka play your card right). A starting card is drawn from the deck. Then the player has to predict whether the next card will higher or lower. The next card is drawn and if the player is correct, they are again promoted to predict whether the subsequent card will be higher or lower. The game continues until they make a mistake and the playerâ€™s score is represented by the number of cards, they drew begore losing.
 You will build up portfolio items (and thus marks) for achieving the following objectives. Note that each column is incremental. i.e. you are considered to have completed all the preceding entries in a column if you complete one of the later items in that Colum. Each portfolio item enter is worth 5%, meaning that this card base project worth half of the module total for retake. 
You must start by completing the two OO-base portfolio tasks that are marked in bold. You may not proceed with any other task until these have been completed. Once you have completed these, you must email you code to Paul for approval and may then continue with the rest of the portfolio items in any way you see fit. You must submit these items for approval before the final deadline day.

OO-Base portfolio 1
OO#1: write a class to represent single playing card and use it to create an instance of card that corresponds to the 7 of heart.
Functionality portfolio 1
Function#1: either generate two random cards or draw the card from data structure that represents a deck, and printout which is highest. The cards cannot be duplicate.

OO-Base portfolio 2
OO#2
Write a class to represent deck of cards, create an instance of this class that contains all of the cards one would normally find in real-world deck (so single ace, king, queen, and jack of each suite plus all the number cards for each suit).
Functionality portfolio 2
Shuffle the deck and print out the shuffled collections of cards, one after the other.

OO-Base portfolio 3

OO#3
Use the java collection framework classes in an appropriate way.
Functionality portfolio 3
Implement a text base version of higher or lo
